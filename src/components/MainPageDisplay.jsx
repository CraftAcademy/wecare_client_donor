                Every year more than 100 000 tons of food is wasted in stores
                all over Sweden. At the same time there are parants who donâ€™t
                have the economical means to feed their children. We at weCare
                aim to create a bridge between stores and single moms in order
                to reduce food waste and eliminate children not getting enough
                food.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>We at weCare have created a platform where a store can
                register and become a food donor. With our easy to navigate UX a
                store can register food bags and decide when the food bag can be
                picked up. For the moms on the other hand we created a mobile
                app for both Apple and Android users where the user can find
                stores that have available food bags and make a reservation and
                then go to the store and pick it up.
                <br></br>
                {/* <br></br>By registering at weCare you as a store can help not
                only families all over Sweden but also make a huge impact on the
                environment. By reducing food waste we can together stop the
                rapid climate change that is happening right now.
