        Every year more than 100 000 tons of food is wasted in stores all over Sweden. At the same time there are parants who donâ€™t have the economical means to feed their children. We at weCare aim to create a bridge between stores and single moms in order to reduce food waste and eliminate children not getting enough food. 
<br></br><br></br>We at weCare have created a platform where a store can register and become a food donor. With our easy to navigate UX a store can register food bags and decide when the food bag can be picked up. For the moms on the other hand we created a mobile app for both Apple and Android users where the user can find stores that have available food bags and make a reservation and then go to the store and pick it up.
<br></br><br></br>By registering at weCare you as a store can help not only families all over Sweden but also make a huge impact on the environment. By reducing food waste we can together stop the rapid climate change that is happening right now. 
<br></br><br></br>So sign up today, to make a better tomorrow!
