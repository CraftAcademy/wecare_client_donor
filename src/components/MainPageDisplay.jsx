            Every year more than 100 000 tons of food is wasted in stores all
            over Sweden. At the same time there are parants who donâ€™t have the
            economical means to feed their children. We at weCare aim to create
            a bridge between stores and single moms in order to reduce food
            waste and eliminate children not getting enough food.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>We at weCare have created a platform where a store can
            register and become a food donor. With our easy to navigate UX a
            store can register food bags and decide when the food bag can be
            picked up. For the moms on the other hand we created a mobile app
            for both Apple and Android users where the user can find stores that
            have available food bags and make a reservation and then go to the
            store and pick it up.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>By registering at weCare you as a store can help not only
            families all over Sweden but also make a huge impact on the
            environment. By reducing food waste we can together stop the rapid
            climate change that is happening right now.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>So sign up today, to make a better tomorrow!
